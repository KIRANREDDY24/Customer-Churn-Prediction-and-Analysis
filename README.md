# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Analysis

Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis: Developed a customer churn prediction model for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. (Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, AWS (S3, RedShift), SQL, Tableau.)

• Integrated customer data from CRM systems like SAP ECC, SAP S/4 HANA, and call logs into AWS S3.

• Built ETL pipelines using AWS Glue to preprocess and load data into Amazon RedShift.

• Implemented deep learning models to predict customer churn based on historical usage patterns and demographic data.

• Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize churn trends and identify key factors influencing customer retention strategies.
